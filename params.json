Typically, `scrypt` means scrypt with N=1024, R=1, P=1. This algorithm changes R for more granular tuning of memory usage. Currently, there is only the wallet miner and cpuminer(minerd) ported to the new algorithm. The memory usage of scrypt-8-4 is only 4Kbytes, compared to normal scrypt where it is 128Kbytes. This means that GPUs and FPGAs will have a large advantage once they are ported to the algorithm. However, ASICs are not practical to make for Megcoin because of the short \"primary mining\" period of about 1.5 years. If ASICs were produced for the algorithm, it would be near the end of big rewards and when mining is needed more for network stability than for coin generation. \r\n\r\n## Digishield\r\n\r\nThis uses the Digishield difficulty algorithm which has been proven stable by Dogecoin. Although multipools shouldn't be a worry with the unique algorithm parameters, digishield has been proven to handle large hashrate changes very well. \r\n\r\n## Forked from Dogecoin 1.7/Bitcoin 0.9\r\n\r\nBecause it was forked from Dogecoin 1.7, which is forked from Bitcoin 0.9, Megcoin's wallet includes the many advancements that Bitcoin 0.9 has:\r\n\r\n* A faster graphical user interface (supporting Qt5 as well)\r\n* Fixes for transaction malleability\r\n* Services broken up into megcoind, megcoin-cli, and megcoin-qt\r\n* Many more features which can be seen in the bitcoin 0.9 [changelog](https://bitcoin.org/bin/0.9.0/README.txt)\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\n* [Windows (32bit)](http://earlz.net/static/megcoin1.0win32.zip)\r\n* Mac OSX wallet coming soon \r\n\r\nThe source code is available on [github](https://github.com/Megcoin/megcoin) for compiling on Linux and elsewhere\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n* [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/megcoin)\r\n* [website](http://megcoin.com)\r\n\r\n## Block explorers\r\n\r\n* [megchain.earlz.net:8080](http://megchain.earlz.net:8080)\r\n\r\n## Mining\r\n\r\n* [cpuminer](https://bitbucket.org/earlz/megcpuminer) for mining with pools\r\n* The wallet supports mining by using `setgenerate true -1`\r\n\r\nThis should be very easily (and effeciently) mined by GPUs and even FPGAs due to it's low 4Kbyte memory requirement. I do not have the knowledge to port a GPU miner though, so this is why I've only ported cpuminer.\r\n\r\n## Pools\r\n\r\nI'm running a [semi-private pool](http://megpool.earlz.net:8080) (because I don't have the expertise to run a pool reliably) that you can join into if you want. However, right now I recommend setting up p2pools or solomining because like I said, I am not an expert pool runner and I'd hate to lose people's coins\r\n\r\nPools will be listed here as they are made. \r\n\r\n## Nodes\r\n\r\nI've tried to ensure there are plenty of servers for the initial rush of wallet syncs including nodes in the US, Europe, and Japan. However if you have a reliable node, report it to me and I'll add it to this list in case those servers get overloaded or are later scaled down for cost reasons. No addnode arguments should be required right now.\r\n\r\n## Exchanges\r\n\r\nNone yet, but soon! \r\n\r\n## Bounties\r\n\r\nThis will be updated as I mine coins (since I didn't premine any)\r\n\r\nThe biggest item on the list is GPU miners for both Nvidia and AMD\r\n\r\n## Testnet\r\n\r\nAlso, if you would like to test services or mining with Megcoin, I have testnet nodes running so syncing should be trivial","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
